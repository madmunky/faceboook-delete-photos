Delete all your photos from facebook (Working as of 07/12/2021)

Open facebook and browse to your photos
Scroll down so the photos are loaded and then open a console and paste the script

Adjust your short and long wait varibles if it does not work correctly

The process will take some time as its emulating your clicks so best to leave it in the background and keep an eye on it.

I take no responsibility for this, use at your own risk.
